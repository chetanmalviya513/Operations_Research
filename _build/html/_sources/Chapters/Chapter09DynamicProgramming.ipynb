    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last three decades, industries have shifted to a more tech friendly environment. This created a higher demand for programmers, scalable applications, and the ability to improve the applications that consumers and employees use daily. This created a demand for finding better ways to **optimize** programmable applications and increase performance and productivity. Humans are problem solvers, always trying to devise the best way to find a solution. People complete their task in different ways. Some solutions are effective but take time. While other solutions may be finished quickly, the job is sloppy. The same thing can be said about programming code. The goal is to find both an optimal and time efficient solution that can limit the run time of the application and give the user more time to complete other tasks. An excellent method to complete this goal is **dynamic programming**. "

    "### Top-down Recursion & Bottom-Up: The Rod Cutting Problem\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recursion and memoization both take a **top-down approach** to solving the problem. This means that the problem is looked at as a whole and is broken down into pieces, examining each piece to see how it makes a whole. Top-down can even go further by breaking down the parts into sub subparts. The main languages that also focus on top-down approach are COBOL, Fortran, and C.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take a look at a plastic model car for example. For top-down we will start by looking at the model car(the root). Because top-down is a decomposition process, we will break the model car down into pieces. You will have many parts: the engine, wheels, the body, and the interior. All these items are separate, but they end up forming the model car. Because they are separate, this can cause redundancy and communication errors within the program. \n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In most cases, it is better to take a **bottom-up approach** rather than a top-down approach. Bottom-up has a different approach, it uses composition. Instead of starting from the root, it starts from the bottom, the smallest variable types, and moves upward towards the root. This means that we will build it from the ground up. In the model car example, this would be like pulling the model out of the box. All the pieces are connected, but it still needs to be assembled. The pieces represent the subproblems and the sub subproblems. In objected-oriented programming we can define the model car as a class, meaning that all pieces are no longer separated but in constant communication and reduce redundancy. Good examples for bottom-up are object-oriented languages; languages like C++, C#, and Java, all use the bottom-up approach because the object is always identified first. Finally, once we add each piece and put all the pieces together, we will have a functional model car."

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dynamic programming is a method to increase functionality by optimizing and improving time complexity in code that makes recursive calls. Because the values are not being stored, the recursive calls are constantly being repeated. This performance can slow down run time in a program based on the number of calculations that are being repeated. Using memoization, allows a program to store recursive calls into arrays and store the data. The recursive calls are now stored in memory which eliminates multiple functions calls of the same value. Memoization is effective in increasing time complexity and performance, but it still makes recursive calls and depending on the program can create an error based on the number of calls. To correct issues of recursing, performance can be further increased by changing the approach from top-down to a bottom-up approach. Bottom-up looks at subproblems and composes the program from the bottom to the root. This reduces redundancies and provides clearer communication for the program. Ultimately, increasing performance and functionality, allowing applications to call bigger or larger values quickly and effectively."

    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dynamic Programming is incredibly important. Not only does it help change the way people can think to solve a problem, but it helps further optimize programs to be more efficient and handle data more quickly. Using recursion and having the computer calculate a recursive function can bog down the computers space complexity, drastically affecting its time complexity too. Using memoization is a useful tool to help store the recursive data and limit the number of times that the recursive calls must run. However, not all recursive calls completely stop when using memoization and the actual code for using memoization can be tricky. To further improve the code, we can take a different approach and look at building it from the ground up instead of breaking it apart. This is when bottom-up comes into play. We can use more loops and an additional array function to call and store more recursive functions that would have been missed by memoization. In some cases, memoization and bottom-up share the same time complexity, but overall, bottom-up proves to be the most effective when looking at subproblems and trying to find an optimal path."

The miner can move only (right->,right up /,right down\\) that is from a given cell, the miner can move to the cell diagonally up towards the right or right or diagonally down towards the right. Find out maximum amount of gold the miner can collect. \n",
