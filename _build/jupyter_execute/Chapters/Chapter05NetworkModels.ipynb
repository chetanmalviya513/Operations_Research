From early 1960s to present, the development and progress that network model has gone through has always accommodated the rapidly increasing number of users and applications.

    "In Network Models, problems can be presented in many ways. Here, one of the common problem is the shortest route problems. Shortest route problem is a network model problem which has received a great deal of attention for both the practical and theoretical reasons. For instance, given a network with a distance associated with each arc, this network model helps us to find the shortest distance from origin (source) to the destination (which is called sink).\n",
    " \n",
    "These problems can be formulated in real life problems like equipment replacement, capital, investment, project scheduling, and inventory planning. The theoretical interest of this problem is due to the efficient solution problems. Shortest route problems can be interpreted as a network problem very easily. \n",

    "A graph's shortest route issue asks for a path between vertices that has the least total weight of all its edges [5-7].

    "Minimizing the lengths (or \"weights\") of the edges of a tree is known as a minimal spanning tree [2],[3], [4]. A cable company, for example, could wish to build cable in several areas at the same time.  By laying less cable, the cable business saves money. <br>\n",

    "Network model is such a huge topic, it pretty much covers every concepts within the information and technology. One of the reasons why one must understand the concept of network model is because it helps to break down larger problems into smallers ones and split them into chunks so that they can be easilt managed.  They represent a framework for dividing up the tasks needed to implement a network. The basic features of  network model, such as optimization and modularity,  has always been a boon for large scale industries to small businessess which as continuouly helped them enhance and modify systems for a common cause.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, we were so fascinated by this topic and the idea of network science, we wanted to explore the diversity, history and culture of this model. This really got us going."
