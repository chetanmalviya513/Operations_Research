    " In 1921, a French mathematician and politician *Émile Borel (1871–1956)* published several papers on the $Theory$ $Of$ $Games$. He was known as the forgotten father of game theory and famous for his founding work in the areas of measure theory and probability. *Émile Borel* wrote several papers on games of chance and theories of play. Even The acknowledged father of **Game Theory** is *Émile Borel*, A Hungarian-American mathematician *John von Neumann*, who in a series of papers in the 1920s and ’30s established the mathematical framework for all subsequent theoretical developments. During World War II, he was a military strategists in such areas as logistics, submarine warfare, and air defense he drew on ideas that were directly related to game theory. Game theory thereafter developed within the context of the social sciences. Despite such empirically related interests, it is essentially a product of mathematicians. \n",

That is, either there is a way for player 1 to force a win, or there is a way for player 1 to force a tie, or there is a way for player 2 to force a win which can be proof by induction.

    "Our main focus of game theory has been the **Nash Equilibrium**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **Nash Equilibrium** is a way of optimizing an outcome named after John Forbes Nash Jr. However it was first utilized by Antoine Augustin Cournot who was a French philosopher and mathematician. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **Nash Equilibrium** is a very unique way of observing decisions in a very absolute way.A pair of strategies is said to be **Nash Equilibrium** (NE), if the optimal choice of Player A given Player B’s choice coincides with optimal choice of Player B given Player A’s choice. In simple terms, initially neither player knows what the other player will do when deciding or making a choice. Hence NE is a pair of choices/strategies/expectations where neither player wants to change their behaviour even after the strategy/choice of the other player is revealed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see the **Nash Equilibrium** is fairly straightforward. It is simple in a sense that each individual always tries to maximize their own outcome. However, in the real world it isn't always absolute or predictable. It is very hard to predict people!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " Another one of the main ideas we have looked at is dominant strategy. In **Dominant Strategy** there is one optimal strategy for each player irrespective of what strategy the other player adopts. Whatever choice B makes, A should always choose Bottom and whatever choice A makes B should always choose Left."

If contestant 1 chooses to share but contestant 2 chooses to steal then contestant 2 gets all 5 marbles. If both contestants choose to steal then 3 marbles go to the game master and each contestant gets a single marble. Give the players a timer for how long they can talk and how long they have to make a decision. Or you could simply take away the ability to talk all together and only give them time to make a decision. Have them write their decision on the scrap paper. You could play this for a few rounds and award either bonus points or candy based on how many marbles each player gained in total!"
